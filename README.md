# Using "Stocks", the real-time terminal-based quote monitor

# Instructions
1. rename ```.env.example``` to ```.env```
2. ```npm install```
3. ```npm start```

Adjust the ```REFRESH_RATE_MILLISECONDS``` in the .env file. The default is 500.

##
Planned upgrades:
- Edit the monitor during runtime
- Add more stock exchanges explicitly (you may be able to figure out how to use international)
